The playlist is implemented in the form of a list, which can be controlled dynamically by touching, in addition to the standard control buttons.
Right during playback, you can delete tracks by doing right or left swipe (or using the delete button with multiple selections), pinch and drag any track to any place in the list, group tracks by moving the selected ones to the top of the list, and also use standard control functions, for example, go to the next track, pause, move, turn on repeat mode and e.t.c.
